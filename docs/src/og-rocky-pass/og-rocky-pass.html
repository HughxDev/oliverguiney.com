            <ul>
              <li>For mood I was looking at screenshots of Prometheus as all as photos of hilly mountains in early evening lighting</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Looking at mountains from Ireland, Switzerland, and Iceland to explore cool rock formations</li>
              <li>I found some old master paintings of shepherds; they usually grouped the sheep into bigger light shapes, with the shepherd more vertical and dark in value</li>
              <li>Part of Prometheus was shot at The Old Man in the Mountain, so that was my visual cue for the design of the jagged rock shapes</li>
              <li>I also researched different types of vernacular architecture for the straw huts, and tried to incorporate similar props from the photos</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The initial plate had a few issues: mostly it was too noisy everywhere and felt unbalanced</li>
              <li>It was good in that the lighting was pretty even making it easy to play with</li>
              <li>Having the value structure already established made it easier to integrate new elements</li>
              <li>I kept the path in the shot because it reinforces the perspective nicely</li>
