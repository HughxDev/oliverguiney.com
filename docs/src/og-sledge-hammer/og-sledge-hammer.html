            <ul>
              <li>Looking back on this piece, I realized a lot wasn’t working, mainly: the mood/lighting weren’t selling the idea enough</li>
              <li>The perspective was getting skewed because of too many randomly tilted walls, and the hardwood floor was wonky</li>
              <li>The texturing was feeling amateurish and indecisive</li>
              <li>Not enough value separation between background and foreground, needs more of a graphic read</li>
              <li>I still thought that the composition and story were cool, so I tried to give it another go</li>

            <p>For mood I was looking at Friday the Thirteenth screenshots to try and hit the horror vibe I was going for</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Using a better understanding of Modo since making the original, I was able to start off with way more of a head start at the 3D stage</li>
              <li>I arranged the lighting to be more like the Jason Voorhees screenshots, rim lighting on the villain character with an upshot</li>
              <li>I also fixed the perspective issues by straightening the walls and modeling out some basic wooden planks to reinforce perspective on the floor</li>
              <li>In the final I have more of a graphic triangular lighting pattern, which looking back I could have done in the 3D as well</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Since the hazmat guy is mostly covered, I knew that it would be easier to have him be just 3D, since marvelous is good at folds</li>
              <li>I did a beauty render with both characters that I overlaid onto my scene, and then played with blending modes and warping to line it up and match the lighting</li>
              <li>Got another photoshoot in to get the dead guy since the pose was kind of awkward and the 3D wasn’t working as well</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Before adjustments: taking it from here to the finished version is mostly just pushing the grading toward those same screenshots</li>
              <li>I got <abbr>crit</abbr> suggesting that the light be a bit more dramatic, and triangular; this forced the focus to be on the characters and gave it a more of a harsh graphic look, which fit nicely with the target mood</li>
              <li>I’m also using little overpaints and mixer brush for detail control and consistency</li>
              <li>I learned a lot by reworking this older piece, it really helps give perspective to the changes in decision making and working habits that you pick up along the way!</li>
