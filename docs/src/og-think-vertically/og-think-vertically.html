            <ul>
              <li>For the mood I was looking at stills from the movie Sunshine, real labs, and an awesome piece by Luke Berliner</li>

              <li>Using MODO I modeled out some reusable assets based on ref</li>
              <li>Adding them to my modo preset library made it super easy to kitbash different compositions in 3D</li>

            <ul>
              <li>I struggled to nail down the comp because I wasn’t approaching the design in a systematic way, it just wasn’t FEELING like a hydroponics lab</li>
              <li>By doing more research and focusing on functionality, I was able to find a cool space that also fufilled the brief, and looked more believable</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Using an iPhone camera and a Galaxy S4 camera, I did a photoshoot getting coverage on various poses in correct lighting and perspective</li>
              <li>By using two phones I was able to get different exposures and see which one worked best for scene integration</li>

            <ul>

            <ul>
              <li>By exporting my scene as an FBX I was able to import my camera into KeyShot</li>
              <li>Then by messing with the settings I was able to line up the shot to to the modo version to get the final composite render that I used as my base</li>

              <li>Pixel squid for toolbox</li>
              <li>From here it’s just a matter of overpainting, fogging a bit, getting greebly textures in, and really pushing the lighting/grading towards the mood</li>
