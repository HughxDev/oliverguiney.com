            <p>Looking at a lot of real life temples with different architectural styles and trying to find something that would fit a world where dragons can be seen as gods in a somewhat believable way</p>

            <ul>
              <li>For the dragon I looked at a lot of bronze sculptures and statues of ancient gods</li>
              <li>I wanted to get some Batman-esque shapes, something that felt iconic, some gargoyles I found gave off a similar vibe</li>
              <li>I really liked some of the angular shapes in the sculptures by John Maisano, his work already seemed like it was based in fantasy so I wanted to use some of that</li>
              <li>For the design of the dragon I was looking at Game of Thrones and Reign of Fire; They both had a simplistic approach trading in all the gimmicky frills for something more laid back and classy</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>The lighting in <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> is LEGIT, so I knew for a dark fantasy piece this was the place to look</li>
              <li>The way they pull off an ominous mood is with silhouetted characters, top down back lighting with lots of blue/cyan light and fiery orange accents</li>
              <li>I tried to set up my scene in a similar way</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The biggest struggle I had doing this piece was nailing down the design and material of the dragon</li>
              <li>I was thinking too much with my concept art brain, trying too hard to design something cool instead of thinking about what would make the most sense for the story</li>
              <li>Based on feedback I realized that one of the first designs I did was working better because it was straightforward and had a material that matched the idea of an ancient deity statue in a throne room, so I iterated on that for the final</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Using a base mesh from daz 3D I was able to easily pose the dragon and play with sliders for general shape and proportions which made it easy to iterate different designs</li>
              <li>I then oversculpted it in zbrush so I could have more creative freedom with design</li>
              <li>I went for a look that was similar to my ref: angular sculpture, minimal frills/spikes, old looking</li>
            </ul>

          <og-portfolio__slide data-carousel-slide="" title-of-work="Character: Photoshoot" filename-id="Process 07">
            <ul>
              <li>For the main figure I wasn’t finding the right photos online and the 3D version was looking weird so I got a cloak and posed it myself</li>
              <li>I was looking at Chase Stone’s artwork and noticed that his characters are super expressive with their body language, even if they’re in the background</li>
              <li>-In earlier versions I had only one guy bowing to the dragon, but his head was closer to the floor so there wasn’t as much of a dialogue between the two</li>
              <li>Showing the guy in the water also helps sells the function of the space since it’s being used as part of a ritual</li>
