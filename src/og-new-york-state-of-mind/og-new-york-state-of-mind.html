            <ul>
              <li>I wanted this piece to feel like a screenshot from a movie so I was looking at <cite>Heat</cite>, and <cite>GTAV</cite>, as well as great car chase scenes like the one from <cite>Bullit</cite> and also <cite>The Dark Knight</cite></li>
              <li>I also recently visited NYC so I was taking pictures throughout brooklyn, some of them had cool light shapes from the train platforms so I knew I wanted to use that in some way</li>

              <li>I sketched out a few ideas in 3D using downloaded models for the car and armored truck</li>
              <li>This made it easy to get different camera angles and try to play cinematographer</li>
              <li>Since I didn’t have the benefit of a moving scene, I wanted a comp that was going to be dynamic and help sell a sense of motion</li>

              <li>I did a photoshoot for the main character using an M4 airsoft gun</li>
              <li>The main costume was improvised from household clothing</li>
              <li>Since the lighting was the same as the comp, I was able to use the reflection as a texture</li>
              <li>Warping in and masking the reflections allowed me to achieve accurate lighting on the car and gave me an easier time integrating the character</li>

              <li>Since the majority of the piece is figured out by this point, it’s just a matter of getting the right textures in the right places</li>
              <li>I also did photoshoots around my neighborhood so the bg props would have a consistency with lighting, perspective and picture quality</li>
              <li>Then for the home stretch it’s all about unifying everything and pushing the lighting toward my target mood, and in this case adding all the <abbr>VFX</abbr> stuff like sparks, bullet casings and debris</li>
