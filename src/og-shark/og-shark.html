              <li>I really like the graphic, high-contrast style of traditional film noir</li>
              <li>The cinematography often sculpts with light and uses doors and windows as framing devices</li>
              <li>Also the compositions were pretty expressionistic with visible emotions and people operating in the shadows so I wanted to incorporate some of those same elements into my scene</li>

            <ul>
              <li>I was looking at tons of photos of Baltimore to try and get a similar feel with a dilapitated row house</li>
              <li>I also took some pictures around my neighborhood to add some props that might make the scene feel more lived in</li>
              <li>Observing the city at night where I live, I realized that the sky was a lighter value than I expected, and that light pollution gives an eerie haze-like effect to the buildings</li>
